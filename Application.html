    <strong>Subject:Application for Leave</strong><br>
    Respected Sir/Madam,<br>
    I am Sadaf (2301641720095), a student of B.tech 3rd year, CSE (cyber-security) branch. I am writing to formally request leave for 2 days, from 12th August to 13th August 2025, due to illness.
    I am unable to attend the classes during this period as I am experiencing health issues that require rest and recovery. I assure you that I will catch up on any missed assignments and lectures upon my return.
    I kindly request you to grant me leave for these two days.

    
    yours Sincerely,
    Sadaf
    2301641720095
